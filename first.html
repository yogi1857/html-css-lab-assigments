    My country is a land of villages and fields full of bodies. I am proud of his village from which the Indian civilization flourished. Most of the great leaders of our country came from villages. Our fields are fed by mighty rivers like Ganges, Yamuna, Brahmaputra, Godavari, Narmada, Krishna and Kavery . The Gangetic Valley is the most fertile region of our country.

    The oceans bathing its shores on three sides and the mighty Himalayas to the north have given my country natural boundaries. Once again, the attraction of the mountain has attracted many adventures to this land of rich culture.
